# Contributing

The contributing flow goes as follows.

- Branch from master.
- Add your source code in a file in the `src/main` directory.
- Add a test file in the `src/test` directory having the same name as your source file and the
  extension `.test.ts`.
  - At the moment we can only run the test by including the file in `src/test/index.ts`, so make
    sure to import the file.
  - Note that we currently have to run all the tests and have no way of running only specific ones.
- Make sure your tests pass by running `make test`.
- When creating a commit please follow the convention:
  - `[feat] A new feature was added`
  - `[chore] modified some build files around, modified gitignore, etc`
  - `[refactor] made some code more readble`
  - `[perf] made some function faster`
  - `[docs] modified some documeation, this includes readme`
  - `[breaking-change] moved function 'x' to project 'y'.`
  - `[other] some useful message`

  A tag with the convention `[tag:subtitle] message` is also accepted. The point of using a tag
  is to be able to filter out the commit messages when creating a `CHANGELOG`. These make it easier
  to generate a summary of the changes.

- Make a pull request.

## Pre-releasing

Only members of iOFFICE may create a pre-release in any branch by running

```bash
make preRelease
```

The output of the command will provide the beta version number assigned to the pre-release. The
pre-released version is tagged so you may also install it by doing

```
yarn add @ioffice/svg2png@next
```

## Releasing

To make a release do the following:

- Create the branch `release` from the `master` branch.
- Update the `package.json` with the proper version number.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` documenting all the changes.
- Create a pull request.
- If everything is good, then merge.

Shortly after the branch is merged, the continous integration tool will do another build and the
package will be released to whichever registry is specified in the `package.json` file.
